# HAB-Taxi-Services-Project
Created as a final group project for the first semester's "Python Programming" course at Keyin College. This program was created as a collaborative effort between six members including myself, options 4, 5, and 7 are not available. My contributions consisted of delegating tasks, creating the receipt designs (HAB Taxi Services Receipt Design.pdf), creating mock data for use in the application (Defaults.dat, employees.txt, expenses.txt, and revenue.txt), coding much of the DH.py file after solving various issues that prevented it from running as expected, helping implement and debug components to ensure the code from all members worked correctly and efficiently as part of the overall program (Main.py), and fixing major bugs to ensure the program ran smoothly regardless of the complexity of interactions between the subcomponents. The final project also included unrelated components not detailed here, such as Python code for a robot navigating an obstacle course and the creation, reading, and displaying of a JSON file in the console.

The requirements that were followed to create this program can be found in the "HAB Taxi Services Instructions.pdf" file in this repo. This program automatically checks the current date; if it is after the first day of the preceding month, it adds 'stand fees' to the appropriate drivers and prints a statement confirming the update. It then displays a menu for the user to select the desired subprogram and runs it.
